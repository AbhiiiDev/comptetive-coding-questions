inear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until
the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
It is the easiest searching algorithm.

 Follow the given steps to solve the problems related to it :

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesn’t match with any of the elements, return -1.

Linear Search Recursive Approach:

Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

1. If the size of the array is zero then, return -1, representing that the element is not found. 
2. This can also be treated as the base condition of a recursion call.
3. Otherwise, check if the element at the current index in the array is equal to the key or not i.e, arr[size – 1] == key
4. If equal, then return the index of the found key.
