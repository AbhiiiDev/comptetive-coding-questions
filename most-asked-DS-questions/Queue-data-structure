A queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in a list in a systematic manner. 
The items are added to the queue at the rear end until they are full, at which point they are removed from the queue from the front.
Queues are commonly used in situations where the users want to hold items for a long period of time, such as during a checkout process. 
A good example of a queue is any queue of customers for a resource where the first consumer is served first.
