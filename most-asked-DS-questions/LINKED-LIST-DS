> A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object.
> Each element (that is node) of a list is comprised of two items â€“ the data and a reference to the next node. 

Types of Linked List : 

1. Singly Linked List : In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of the next node in the list
and the last node has next address or reference as NULL.
For example 1->2->3->4->NULL

2. Doubly Linked List : Here, here are two references associated with each node, One of the reference points to the next node
and one to the previous node. 
Eg. NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL

3. Circular Linked List : Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle.
There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or a doubly circular linked list.
Eg. 1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of the last node is pointing to the first]
